about_content: | 
  I am a locum Performance Analyst Assistant at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, and also a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia. With a strong foundation in Sport Science [BSc (Honours) from NTU], I enjoy contributing towards data-driven decision making to optimise athletic performance and enhance analytical workflow processes.

  My technical expertise centres on using **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2) for data cleaning, visualisation, and predictive modelling. I am interested in applying machine learning concepts—such as Random Forests and XGBoost—to sports data, and recently looking into computer vision to aid in notational analyses. 

  My current focus areas include:
    - **Football Analytics:** Analysing tactical trends and player stats in the Singapore Premier League.
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in Athletics, Badminton, and Water Polo through video or data analysis.

      **Technical Skills**
      I rely heavily on the **R Programming Language** for my daily analysis, specifically the `tidyverse` suite for data manipulation and visualisation. I also had previous experience with **Tableau** for dashboarding and **SPSS/JASP** for statistical testing. I am currently expanding my skillset in Machine Learning algorithms to better predict sporting outcomes.

      **Interests**
      Outside of academic and professional work, I am an avid follower of the **Singapore Premier League** and use *Football Manager* as a sandbox for tactical setups and expanding my regional/continental knowledge of other clubs. And of course, I strive to keep fit & healthy!
