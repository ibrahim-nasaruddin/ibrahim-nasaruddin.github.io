about_content: | 
  Hi there! I'm Ibrahim. I am currently a Performance Analyst (part-time) at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, as well as a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia.

  I created this page to showcase my projects and technical growth. Coming from a background in Sport Science with experience in health coaching and youth strength & conditioning, I have always loved the challenge of optimising athletic performance. I enjoy piecing together the 'human performance puzzle' to find individualised solutions. Through this work, I realised I relished the process of data visualisation and- more importantly- the power of a data-informed approach to aid decision-making and analytical workflows.
  
  My current areas of interest include:
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in various sports (including Athletics, Water Polo, Badminton) through video or data analysis.
    - **Enhancing workflow processes** Identifying bottlenecks in workflow processes and implementing tech-aided solutions that improve productivity.

    layout: text
    content: |
      **Technical Skills**

      I rely heavily on the **R Programming Language** for my daily analysis. I also had previous experience with **Tableau** and **R Shiny** for dashboarding and **SPSS/JASP** for statistical testing. I am currently expanding my skillset in Machine Learning algorithms to better predict sporting outcomes and also learning MS Power BI as an alternative dashboarding tool.

      **Interests**

      Outside of academic and professional work, I am an avid follower of the **Singapore Premier League** and use *Football Manager* as a sandbox for tactical setups and expanding my regional/continental knowledge of other clubs. I occasionally post visualisation plots of team/player stats of the Singapore Premier League on my X account when time permits. I love my time with my family and feel at peace during nature walks. And of course, I strive to keep fit & healthy!
