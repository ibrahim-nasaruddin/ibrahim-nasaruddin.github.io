  Hi there! I'm Ibrahim. I am currently a Performance Analyst (part-time) at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, as well as a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia.

  I created this page to showcase my projects and technical growth. Coming from a background in Sport Science with experience in health coaching and youth strength & conditioning, I have always loved the challenge of optimising human/athletic performance. I enjoy piecing together the 'human performance puzzle' to find individualised solutions. Through this work, I realised I relished the process of quantification (the whole "Assess, don't guess" spiel). This naturally led to a fascination with data visualisation and- more importantly- the power of a data-informed approach to aid decision-making and analytical workflows.
    
  My current areas of interest include:
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in various sports (including Athletics, Water Polo, Badminton) through video or data analysis.
    - **Enhancing workflow processes:** Identifying bottlenecks in workflow processes and implementing tech-aided solutions that improve productivity.

        A platform built to evaluate Singapore Premier League players using event data powered by **Hudl Wyscout**. This tool translates raw statistics into actionable recruitment insights through statistical normalisation.
        <br><br>
        **Key Functionalities:**
        * **Z-Score Standardisation:** Comparing players on a balanced league-wide scale ($0$ = League Average) to identify elite outliers.
        * **Head-to-Head Radar Profiles:** Visualizing strengths and weaknesses across shooting, progression, and defensive metrics.
        * **Performance Differential:** Automated "Delta" tables calculating the specific statistical edge one player has over another.
        * **Local Talent Filter:** A specialized view for domestic player identification and tracking.

        As Singapore Premier League action returns, I used simple but informative visual ranks to compare players’ key chance-creation and goal threat metrics to highlight early standouts and underperformers across the league.

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With most having at least 4 games under their belt, here&#39;s a look at the goalscorers so far.<br><br>NOTE: Excluded players with 0 xG AND 0 goals <a href="https://t.co/r505VDI7Xf">pic.twitter.com/r505VDI7Xf</a></p>&mdash; Ibrahim Nasaruddin (@Ibranalytics) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ibranalytics/status/2011619287321256221?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        Standard classification models ask **if** a player will get injured (Yes/No). Survival Analysis asks **when**.
        <br><br>
        By failing to account for *time* and *exposure*, binary predictions often miss the nuance of accumulated fatigue. This project uses **Survival Analysis** to model the "time-to-event" for non-contact injuries in a simulated 25-man squad over 4 seasons.
        <br><br>
        **Key Concepts Covered:**
        * **Right Censoring:** Handling data for players who *don't* get injured.
        * **Kaplan-Meier Curves:** Visualising the "135-Day Wall" where injury risk spikes.
        * **Cox Proportional Hazards:** Quantifying the "cost" of being a Key Starter (Hazard Ratios) vs. a Fringe player.

        A production-grade dashboard inspired by my work with the High Performance Sport Institute (HPSI). I designed this tool to explore and streamline the analysis workflow, automating the ingestion of mock Hudl Sportscode data to move beyond manual reporting.
        <br><br>
        By shifting the focus from data entry to tactical exploration, it empowers analysts to prioritize coaching conversations. Key features include dynamic pass networks, momentum tracking, and defensive KPI visualisation.

        This project adapts the "Dangerousity" construct—originally developed for football analytics by <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5201291/" target="_blank">Link et al. (2016)</a>—to the sport of basketball. The objective was to quantify the instantaneous probability of a player scoring based on spatiotemporal tracking data.
        <br><br>
        **The Framework:**
        * **Zone (ZO<sub>b</sub>):** Quantifies spatial scoring probability based on distance and angle, adjusted for 2-point vs. 3-point incentives.
        * **Control (CO<sub>b</sub>):** Dynamic calculation of the ball handler's control based on speed and dribbling status.
        * **Pressure (PR<sub>b</sub>):** Defensive intensity measured by Euclidean distance to defenders and contextual time pressure (shot clock/game clock).
        * **Density (DE<sub>b</sub>):** Analysis of obstruction in both the "Shot Corridor" and "Passing Lanes."

      **Interests**
      <br>
      Outside of academic and professional work, I am an avid follower of the **Singapore Premier League** and use *Football Manager* as a sandbox for tactical setups. I occasionally post visualisation plots of SPL stats on my X account. I love spending time with my family and feel at peace during nature walks.
      <br>

      ### My non-linear path in sport science
      
      If you had asked me in 2010 what I wanted to do with my life, I wouldn’t have had an answer. I was too busy trying to survive my first year of Junior College. But my obsession with human performance didn’t start in a lab; it started on a track. 
      
      That 12-second blur in a 100m race ignited a desire to understand *why* I was fast. I spent hours dissecting YouTube clips of Asafa Powell, frame-by-frame, trying to understand human force generation.
      
      My journey involved academic hurdles and repeating years, but those moments hardened me. I realized that my previous struggles weren’t a lack of ability; they were a lack of *purpose*.
      
      <br>
      ## When peak curiosity led to peak performance
      <br>
      During National Service, I dove into exercise physiology journals to understand hypertrophy and training zones. I was already thinking like a sport scientist—using data as a lever to understand performance.
      
      <br>
      ## The Turning Point: Finding Redemption at RP
      <br>
      The turning point came in 2016 when I discovered the Diploma in Sport and Exercise Sciences at Republic Polytechnic. For the first time, my curiosity was being fed. I realized that true God-consciousness (*Taqwa*) involves a constant striving toward refining one’s character through the pursuit of excellence (*Ihsan*).
      
      <br>
      ## My Philosophy: Grit & Growth
      <br>
      My philosophy is simple: **How can I make a positive difference in someone else’s life?** I believe in a growth mindset with an abundance outlook—to collaborate rather than compete. I see my credentials not as a success story, but as an invitation for others to introspect on their own purpose and unlock their potential.
