  Hi there! I'm Ibrahim. I am currently a Performance Analyst (part-time) at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, as well as a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia.

  I created this page to showcase my projects and technical growth. Coming from a background in Sport Science with experience in health coaching and youth strength & conditioning, I have always loved the challenge of optimising human/athletic performance. I enjoy piecing together the 'human performance puzzle' to find individualised solutions. Through this work, I realised I relished the process of quantification (the whole "Assess, don't guess" spiel). This naturally led to a fascination with data visualisation and- more importantly- the power of a data-informed approach to aid decision-making and analytical workflows.
    
  My current areas of interest include:
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in various sports (including Athletics, Water Polo, Badminton) through video or data analysis.
    - **Enhancing workflow processes:** Identifying bottlenecks in workflow processes and implementing tech-aided solutions that improve productivity.

        As Singapore Premier League action returns, I used simple but informative visual ranks to compare players’ key chance-creation and goal threat metrics to highlight early standouts and underperformers across the league.

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With most having at least 4 games under their belt, here&#39;s a look at the goalscorers so far.<br><br>NOTE: Excluded players with 0 xG AND 0 goals <a href="https://t.co/r505VDI7Xf">pic.twitter.com/r505VDI7Xf</a></p>&mdash; Ibrahim Nasaruddin (@Ibranalytics) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ibranalytics/status/2011619287321256221?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        Standard classification models ask **if** a player will get injured (Yes/No). Survival Analysis asks **when**.
        <br><br>
        By failing to account for *time* and *exposure*, binary predictions often miss the nuance of accumulated fatigue. This project uses **Survival Analysis** to model the "time-to-event" for non-contact injuries in a simulated 25-man squad over 4 seasons.
        <br><br>
        **Key Concepts Covered:**
        * **Right Censoring:** Handling data for players who *don't* get injured.
        * **Kaplan-Meier Curves:** Visualising the "135-Day Wall" where injury risk spikes.
        * **Cox Proportional Hazards:** Quantifying the "cost" of being a Key Starter (Hazard Ratios) vs. a Fringe player.

        This project adapts the "Dangerousity" construct—originally developed for football analytics by <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5201291/" target="_blank">Link et al. (2016)</a>—to the sport of basketball. The objective was to quantify the instantaneous probability of a player scoring based on spatiotemporal tracking data.
        <br><br>
        **The Framework:**
        Adopting a rationalistic approach, I constructed a Dangerousity (DA) formula derived from four weighted components:
        * **Zone (ZO<sub>b</sub>):** Quantifies spatial scoring probability based on distance and angle, adjusted for 2-point vs. 3-point incentives.
        * **Control (CO<sub>b</sub>):** Dynamic calculation of the ball handler's control based on speed and dribbling status.
        * **Pressure (PR<sub>b</sub>):** Defensive intensity measured by Euclidean distance to defenders and contextual time pressure (shot clock/game clock).
        * **Density (DE<sub>b</sub>):** Analysis of obstruction in both the "Shot Corridor" and "Passing Lanes."
        * **Availability:**

      ### My non-linear path in sport science
      
      If you had asked me in 2010 what I wanted to do with my life, I wouldn’t have had an answer. I was too busy trying, and failing, to survive my first year of Junior College (newsflash—I didn’t, and had to repeat the year). But if you had looked past my report card and checked my search history, the answer was already there.
      
      My obsession with human performance didn’t start in a lab; it started on a track, almost by accident. During Sports Day, my “House” needed to fill a slot for the 100m race, and I was involuntarily signed up. I had no training and no expectations. But when the gun went off, I realised I had something. I crossed the finish line in second place, and that stunned me. That 12-second blur ignited a desire to understand *why* I was (relatively) fast, and how I could be faster. I spent hours dissecting low-quality YouTube clips of Asafa Powell, frame-by-frame, trying to understand how a human being could generate that kind of force.
      
      I repeated my first year in 2011 and eventually sat for my A-Levels in 2012. But the result was a crushing, silent sort of failure. I didn’t do well enough to make it to university. It was the kind of moment that makes you question not just your intelligence, but your character. *Why couldn’t I make myself care?* Back then, I didn't have the tools to answer that. I simply retreated into a state of self-pity, victimising myself and remaining blind to the harmful patterns in my behavior that were keeping me stagnant.
      
      <br>
      ## When peak curiosity led to peak performance
      <br>
      In 2013, I enlisted for National Service. This should have been a pause in my academic worries, but it actually became the incubator for my future…I just didn’t know it yet. You see, I was a scrawny kid who was about to become a police officer. The reality of patrolling the streets weighed on me; I wanted to cut a more physical figure, to be useful and capable. For the first time, I had a "Why" that was bigger than a report card. So, I turned to the only thing that made sense to me: data.
      
      I dove into articles underpinned by exercise physiology journals to understand hypertrophy and the best programmes for my build. I researched footwear biomechanics to keep myself on the road for 10Ks despite my flat feet. I started monitoring my heart rate with the intensity of a lab technician, training via zones rather than feel. On hindsight, I was already thinking like a sport scientist—using data as a lever to understand and enhance my own performance.
      
      I finished my service in March 2015, and the heavy reality of my 2012 results came rushing back. Serving in the police force had given me a sense of duty and a purpose to protect the nation, but it also served as a convenient distraction from my academic failure. Once the uniform was off, the crossroads returned. After long discussions with my family, I grudgingly decided to try one last time. I registered as a private A-Level candidate for the end of the year, but my heart was still divided. 
      
      For most of 2015, I lived a double life. By day, I worked part-time at a kebab shop, slicing meat and serving customers to make ends meet. By night, I sat with private tutors, trying to force information into a brain that still seemed to reject the traditional path. It was a year defined by a suffocating sense of purposelessness. I battled constant dejection and a crippling lack of self-confidence. Watching my peers move on while I stagnated made me lose hope almost daily. Yet, I kept showing up. I kept slicing meat, and I kept opening those textbooks even when I felt like it was futile.
      
      When the results came out, to no one’s surprise, least of all mine, I hadn’t done much better. I still couldn't enter university. But looking back, that failure wasn't wasted time. Forcing myself to function through that loss of hope taught me a resilience that no classroom ever could. I learned how to keep moving forward even when the destination was invisible.
     
      <br>
      ## The Turning Point: Finding Redemption at RP
      <br>
      The turning point finally came in January 2016. My dad dropped a brochure for the **Diploma in Sport and Exercise Sciences at Republic Polytechnic** in front of me. “Just check it out,” he said. I was skeptical. Despite my obsession with training data during NS, I had never considered Sport Science a “real” or viable career route. But I went to the open house that January, and for the first time in six years, the noise in my head stopped. The lecturers weren’t talking about abstract theories; they were talking about *my* language. I enrolled in April 2016, and this time, the stakes were different. I wasn’t just studying for a grade; I was studying for redemption.
      
      It was also during this time that my faith took a more central role in my life by being my guiding compass. I realised that as a Muslim, being content and grateful for God’s decree doesn’t mean resting on one’s laurels or accepting mediocrity. Rather, true God-consciousness (*Taqwa*) involves a constant striving toward refining one’s character, which necessitates self-improvement (*Tazkiyah-al-Nafs*) and the pursuit of excellence (*Ihsan*). 
      
      So in RP, I led a different kind of double life—one fueled by purpose rather than dejection. My weeks were packed: classes Monday to Friday, training twice a week with RP Athletics, volunteering all of Saturday to give back to the community, and spending Sunday mornings doing part-time tutoring. There was even a period of time where I couldn’t remember my own HDB block colour, because most days I left the house before sunrise and only got back after dark. I gradually adopted a **growth mindset** and began to dismantle the harmful patterns that had held me back for years. I excelled because my curiosity was finally being fed, but also because the previous years of "failure" had hardened me. I realized that my academic struggles in 2010 and 2012 weren’t a lack of ability; they were a lack of *purpose*.

      ## My Philosophy: Grit & Growth
      <br>
      My philosophy became simple: **How can I make a positive difference in someone else’s life?** Drawing from my journey, I saw the importance of stabilising my own ship first— for how else can we pour from an empty cup? Sport Science allowed me to stabilise that foundation. It gave me the tools to understand myself physically and intellectually, and my faith gave me the spiritual mandate to never settle for mediocrity when excellence was possible. In doing so, it gave me the confidence to believe I could help athletes understand themselves too.
      
      Today, I believe in a growth mindset with an **abundance outlook**. I look to collaborate, not to compete. I firmly believe there is enough of the pie to go around, and that we rise when we lift others around us. I see my academic credentials not as a "success story" to wave about(especially mindful of humblebragging, self-promotion and seeking external validation too!), but as an invitation for those seeking to introspect on their own purpose and unlock their potential. (And while hard work played its part, I must acknowledge my privilege: I had a "village" that supported me, enabling me the time and space to pursue this redemption.)
      
      This journey informs every part of my professional life. Whether I am coaching a client, building a performance dashboard, or training a machine learning model, I’m not just crunching mindless numbers. I’m looking for that same feeling of curiosity and obsessiveness I had during that Sports Day race in 2010. It is the search for an edge, the desire to be better, and the deeply human need to understand *why*. It took me a long time, two failed attempts at A-Levels, and a stint in a kebab shop to get here. But looking back, I needed every step of the long way round.
