about_content: | 
  Hi there! I'm Ibrahim. I am currently a Performance Analyst (part-time) at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, as well as a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia.

  I created this page to showcase my projects and technical growth. Coming from a background in Sport Science with experience in health coaching and youth strength & conditioning, I have always loved the challenge of optimising athletic performance. I enjoy piecing together the 'human performance puzzle' to find individualised solutions. Through this work, I realised I relished the process of quantification (the whole "Assess, don't guess" spiel). This naturally led to a fascination with data visualisation and- more importantly- the power of a data-informed approach to aid decision-making and analytical workflows.
  
  My current areas of interest include:
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in various sports (including Athletics, Water Polo, Badminton) through video or data analysis.
    - **Enhancing workflow processes** Identifying bottlenecks in workflow processes and implementing tech-aided solutions that improve productivity.

        A production-grade dashboard inspired by my work with the High Performance Sport Institute (HPSI). I designed this tool to explore and streamline the analysis workflow, automating the ingestion of mock Hudl Sportscode data to move beyond manual reporting.
        <br><br>
        By shifting the focus from data entry to tactical exploration, it empowers analysts to prioritize coaching conversations. Key features include dynamic pass networks, momentum tracking, and defensive KPI visualisation.

        This project adapts the "Dangerousity" construct—originally developed for football analytics by Link et al. (2016)—to the sport of basketball. The objective was to quantify the instantaneous probability of a player scoring based on spatiotemporal tracking data.
        <br><br>
        **The Framework:**
        Adopting a rationalistic approach, I constructed a Dangerousity (DA) formula derived from four weighted components:
        * **Zone (ZO<sub>b</sub>):** Quantifies spatial scoring probability based on distance and angle, adjusted for 2-point vs. 3-point incentives.
        * **Control (CO<sub>b</sub>):** Dynamic calculation of the ball handler's control based on speed and dribbling status.
        * **Pressure (PR<sub>b</sub>):** Defensive intensity measured by Euclidean distance to defenders and contextual time pressure (shot clock/game clock).
        * **Density (DE<sub>b</sub>):** Analysis of obstruction in both the "Shot Corridor" and "Passing Lanes."
        <br><br>
        **Availability:**
        To maintain academic integrity regarding assignment reuse, the full academic paper and the associated R code are not published publicly but are available upon request for professional review.

        Data-driven analysis of defensive performance in the Singapore Premier League's 2024/25 season. Examines SPL defenders through objective metrics including duel success rates, clearances, and errors leading to shots. Uses statistical analysis to identify standout performers like Toni Datković and Bailey Wright, while highlighting the importance of tactical context when evaluating defensive contributions.

      <br>
      Outside of academic and professional work, I am an avid follower of the **Singapore Premier League** and use *Football Manager* as a sandbox for tactical setups and expanding my regional/continental knowledge of other clubs. I occasionally post visualisation plots of team/player stats of the Singapore Premier League on my X account when time permits. I love my time with my family and feel at peace during nature walks. And of course, I strive to keep fit & healthy!
