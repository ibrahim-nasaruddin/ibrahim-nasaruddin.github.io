about_content: | 
  I am a Performance Analyst (part-time) at the High Performance Sport Institute in Singapore, and also a Master of Sport Analytics student at La Trobe University in Australia. I have a strong background in sport science and have had working experiences as a health coach and youth strength & conditioning coach. I enjoy contributing towards data-driven decision making to optimise athletic performance and enhance analytical workflow processes.

  My technical expertise centres on using **R** (tidyverse, ggplot2) for data cleaning, visualisation, and predictive modelling. I am interested in applying machine learning concepts (such as Random Forests and XGBoost) to sports data, and recently looking into computer vision to aid in notational analyses. 

  My current areas of interest include:
    - **Performance Science:** Supporting elite athletes in various sports (including Athletics, Water Polo, Badminton) through video or data analysis.
    - **Enhancing workflow processes** Identifying areas to optimise workflow processes and finding tech-aided solutions that improves productivity.

    **Technical Skills**
    
    I rely heavily on the **R Programming Language** for my daily analysis. I also had previous experience with **Tableau** and **R Shiny** for dashboarding and **SPSS/JASP** for statistical testing. I am currently expanding my skillset in Machine Learning algorithms to better predict sporting outcomes and also learning MS Power BI as an alternative dashboarding tool.
    
    **Interests**
    
    Outside of academic and professional work, I am an avid follower of the **Singapore Premier League** and use *Football Manager* as a sandbox for tactical setups and expanding my regional/continental knowledge of other clubs. I occasionally post visualisation plots of team/player stats of the Singapore Premier League on my X account when time permits. I love my time with my family and feel at peace during nature walks. And of course, I strive to keep fit & healthy!
